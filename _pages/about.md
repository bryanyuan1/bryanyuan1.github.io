Hi! I am an undergraduate student at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). I've recently received my B.S. in Computer Science in September 2021.

# Research

I am interested in **Deep Reinforcement Learning**, **Robotics**, and a little bit of **Neuroscience**. In general, I care about the application of machine learning algorithms to make the world a better place.

Here are some questions that I care much about:

- **What** problems in the real world can we solve using reinforcement learning/machine learning algorithms?
- **How** to use our algorithms to solve them?
- **Why** do our algorithms work and not others?

In short, if you tell me you're designing a robot chef that cooks your mom's favorite dish, then I'm in.

I've been closely working with [Prof. Marcelo Mattar](https://mattarlab.ucsd.edu/) in a project about improving **experience replay** by re-prioritizing important transitions in the buffer. Our ideas came from his [recent work](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0232-z) in neuroscience, and we've proudly submited our preprint [here](). I've also been concurrently working with [Prof. Michael Yip](https://yip.eng.ucsd.edu/) in [UCSD Advanced Robotics and Controls Lab](https://www.ucsdarclab.com/), where I aimed to automated surgical suturing using **deep reinforcement learning** and **physical simulation** using **[position-based dynamics (PBD)](https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/publications/posBasedDyn.pdf)**. Here are the porfolios for both projects:

- [Reinventing experience replay](/portfolio/exp-replay)
- [Suturing simulation](/portfolio/suturing-sim)
