The project at [UCSD Advanced Robotics and Controls Lab](https://www.ucsdarclab.com/). This is the simulation environment for simulating the deformation of human tissue when a needle penetrates inside, made by OpenGL. It is eventually used to provide a training environment for our deep RL algorithm. Ultimately, we hope to control a robot gripper so that it holds the tissue in the right place, without being pushed too far when we're suturing with the needle.

**Note**: The black dots aligned in a semi-circular shape represents a simplified model of the suturing needle.
